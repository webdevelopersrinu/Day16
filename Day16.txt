1)Understanding File Handling in Python

File handling in Python is an essential skill for any programmer, enabling the manipulation and management of files stored on a computer. Python provides a straightforward and powerful set of tools for working with files, allowing users to read, write, and modify data efficiently. This essay will explore the fundamental concepts of file handling in Python, covering file opening, reading, writing, and closing operations.

A)File Opening:

Before performing any operations on a file, it must be opened using the `open()` function. The `open()` function takes two arguments: the file path and the mode. The mode determines the purpose of opening the file, such as reading, writing, or appending data. Common modes include:

- `'r'`: Read mode (default). Opens a file for reading.
- `'w'`: Write mode. Opens a file for writing. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten.
- `'a'`: Append mode. Opens a file for appending data. New data will be added to the end of the file.
- `'b'`: Binary mode. Opens a file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files like images or executable files.
- `'+'`: Read/write mode. Opens a file for both reading and writing.

Ex:-
file = open('example.txt', 'r')


B)File Reading:

Once a file is opened, its contents can be read using various methods. The most common method is the `read()` function, which reads the entire contents of the file as a string.

Ex:-
content = file.read()


Alternatively, you can read the file line by line using the `readline()` function or read all lines into a list using the `readlines()` function.

Ex:-
line = file.readline()
lines = file.readlines()


C)File Writing:

To write data to a file, it must be opened in write or append mode. Data can then be written using the `write()` function.

Ex:-
file = open('example.txt', 'w')
file.write('Hello, World!\n')
file.close()


It's important to note that the `write()` function does not automatically add newline characters, so they must be included explicitly if needed.

D)File Closing:

After performing operations on a file, it should be closed using the `close()` function. Closing a file releases its resources and ensures that any pending data is written to disk.

Ex:-
file.close()


Alternatively, you can use the `with` statement to automatically close the file after the block of code executes.

Ex:-
for open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()


In conclusion, file handling in Python is a fundamental aspect of programming, allowing users to interact with files efficiently. By understanding how to open, read, write, and close files, programmers can manipulate data stored in files with ease, making Python a versatile tool for various file-related tasks.

2)Lamba function  in python:-
A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It is a way to create functions without needing to give them a name using the def keyword. Lambda functions are often used when you need a simple function for a short period of time and don't want to define a full-fledged function using def. 

The syntax for a lambda function is:

lambda arguments: expression

Lambda functions can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression. They are commonly used in conjunction with functions like map(), filter(), and reduce() to perform operations on iterables in a concise manner. 

For example, a lambda function to double a number can be written as:
Ex:-
double = lambda x: x * 2
print(double(5))  # Output: 10

Lambda functions are particularly useful in scenarios where defining a full function would be overkill, such as in sorting or filtering lists, or as arguments to higher-order functions. However, they should be used judiciously, as overly complex lambda functions can reduce code readability.

3) higher order function:-

Higher-order functions are a cornerstone of functional programming, allowing functions to take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

4)Map function:-

The map function applies a specified function to each item in an iterable (such as a list) and returns a new iterable with the results. It takes two arguments: the function to apply and the iterable. For example:

Ex:-

# Doubling each element in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))
# Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Here, the lambda function lambda x: x * 2 doubles each element in the numbers list.

5) Filter function:-

The filter function, on the other hand, applies a specified function to each item in an iterable and returns a new iterable containing only the items for which the function returns True. It also takes two arguments: the function to apply and the iterable. For example:

Ex:-

# Filtering even numbers from a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
# Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

In this case, the lambda function lambda x: x % 2 == 0 checks if each element in the numbers list is even, and only those that satisfy the condition are included in the even_numbers list.

Both map and filter functions provide a concise and efficient way to manipulate data in Python, making code more readable and expressive.
